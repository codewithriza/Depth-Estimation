**Depth Estimation from Face Width using OpenCV and FaceMesh**

This Python script, made by Riza , utilizes the OpenCV library along with the FaceMesh detection module to estimate the depth of a human face from a webcam feed. 
The code captures video frames from the webcam, detects a face using FaceMesh, and calculates the depth of the face based on the width of the detected face in the image.
The calculated depth is then displayed on the image frame in centimeters.

**Features**:

Captures video frames from the webcam.
Detects a human face using the FaceMesh detection module.
Calculates the depth of the face using a known width and focal length.
Annotates the image frame with the calculated depth in centimeters.
Allows for real-time depth estimation from the webcam feed.
Usage:

Make sure you have the required libraries installed, including cv2 (OpenCV) and cvzone (FaceMeshModule).
Run the script.
A window will open displaying the webcam feed with annotated depth information on the detected face.

**
Note:
**
The script assumes that the camera is calibrated and the known focal length and face width are accurately provided.
The code can be further customized and integrated into applications that require real-time depth estimation, such as augmented reality experiences or depth sensing applications.
